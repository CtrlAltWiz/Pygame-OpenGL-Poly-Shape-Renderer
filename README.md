# Pygame-OpenGL-Poly-Shape-Renderer
A fun Python program that utilizes the Pygame and OpenGL libraries to render 3D models of various polyhedra. This application can be used for various applications, such as educational demonstrations, game development, or as visual representations of geometric shapes.

Features

Generates 3D models of polyhedra using Pygame and OpenGL.
Renders the polyhedra with colors, smooth edges, and shading.
The model rotates for viewing from different angles.
Customizable code that enables you to adjust the appearance and size of the polyhedra.
Suitable for educational purposes and as a starting point for 3D graphics projects.

Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have the following installed:

`Python 3
Pygame
PyOpenGL`

You can install Pygame and PyOpenGL using the following commands:
`pip install pygame`
`pip install PyOpenGL`

Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/CtrlAltWiz/Pygame-OpenGL-Poly-Shape-Renderer.git`

Navigate to the project directory:
`cd Pygame-OpenGL-Poly-Shape-Renderer`

Run the program:
`python PolyShape.py`

Customization

You can customize the appearance of the polyhedra by modifying the code in the PolyShape.py file. Adjust the vertices, edges, and colors to create your own variations.
